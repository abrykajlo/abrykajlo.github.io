Do I pursue the visual arts and be a creative in     the game or VFX industry? Or do I double down on math and science to become a knowledge worker     in an engineering field? I chose the latter, so off I went to Queen's University in Kingston,     Ontario where I did 5 years of applied mathematics in mechanical engineering. Following that     up with a second degree in computer science I was ready to tackle the world.     </p> <p>     Hi! I am Adam Brykajlo and for the last two years I have been working as a software developer     in Vancouver. And while I do love programming, I have a strong creative force in me that is     more and more manifesting it's urge to be visually creative. This website is a manifestation     of that need.     </p> <p>     While the last few years have been spent honing my technical prowess my artistic ability has     stagnated. My interest in 3D modelling is still ever present so the next several months I want     to devote to learning 3D modelling and working on general artistic ability. Once I allow my     artistic ability to catch up I ultimately want to combine my artistic creativity with my     skills in mathematics, science and programming.     </p>"},{"location":"gallery/","title":"Gallery","text":""},{"location":"2018/11/11/life-update-and-some-rust/","title":"Life Update And Some Rust","text":"<p>Writing code and writing words about said code is not my forte. While the coding continued on the WASM renderer I was working on, the blog posts stopped. Life gets busy and habits die hard. Well a lot has happened since then and while I continued the coding portion up until mid-August I have stopped since then. I got to the point of having a full Shader and ShaderProgram class implementation wrapping the OpenGL code.

Well I hate to say it but I think I am going to continue this same project in Rust. Well not hate, I love Rust, it's just that any time you hear WebAssembly you mostly hear \"Rust + WebAssembly\".

I am now proudly and excitedly now working at a game studio in Vancouver, Relic Entertainment. Now whats exciting about Rust is the potential I see it in impacting the games industry. In the last year I have heard of 3 game studios experimenting or outright adopting it. Ready At Dawn has been slowly converting their engine over and Chucklefish is working on an all new game called Witchbrook. I have also heard EAs SEED division has been doing some experimentation. I will post links below.</p>"},{"location":"2018/11/11/life-update-and-some-rust/#what-am-i-hoping-to-see","title":"What Am I Hoping To See?","text":"<p>I think the most interesting thing with Rust is the ability to see the bigger picture without having to know the world. I have dabbled in Rust but I have yet to write any multithreaded code, Rusts namesake. Being able to start tackling concurrency without fear is a big thing to achieve. When you have many people of different skill levels touching a complicated code base something is bound to get broken (like all the time). Even the most skilled developers make mistakes from time to time. Rust enables its users by mitigating the types of mistakes available to make. Sticking to safe Rust means you're mostly only bound by logical errors. I hope to see more tools being created for content creators. Tools which have greater stability and less bugs which can have quicker release cycles without succumbing to crashes. It would be great to see companies be more productive and not have to overwork employees when approaching a deadline (games industry crunch!!??!?). I think there is huge potential for games to be more polished since play testing can focus on the gameplay and not on bugs or crashes.</p>"},{"location":"2018/11/11/life-update-and-some-rust/#what-am-i-hoping-to-achieve","title":"What Am I Hoping To Achieve?","text":"<p>I would like to stop dabbling and start making. I am a capable C++ developer but with my level of experience sometimes learning concepts take a backseat to learning nuances of a language or making silly frustrating mistakes. Leaving that behind sounds great. Plus Rust is one of the most enjoyable languages I have used in a long time and I have used a lot of different languages (Haskell, Lisp, Go, Elm to name a few). I have recently finished the Rust Programming Book which I do recommend to anyone trying to learn the language. A great tip by the way if you have rust installed and want to read documentation or the rust book just use <code>rustup doc</code> and you will open a local copy of the doc for the version of rust you have installed. This month is Github's GameOff 2018 and I am working on a simple game by myself. It will be the first game I will write ever in Rust or any language for that matter. Next month is Advent of Code which is 25 days of coding challenges over at Advent of Code which I have commited to coding entirely in Rust...if I can make it the whole month.</p>"},{"location":"2018/11/11/life-update-and-some-rust/#links","title":"Links","text":"<p>Johan Andersson from SEED tweets about Rust</p> <p>Chucklefish whitepaper on Rust at Chucklefish</p> <p>Andrea Pessino, CTO at Ready at Dawn, announces Rust for studio</p> <p>Andrea Pessino how to learn Rust twitter thread</p>"},{"location":"2018/06/29/little-red-box/","title":"Little Red Box","text":"<p>It may not look like much but this little red box is the start of a personal project which I hope will continue on for quite some time. It was in fact the reason why I built this website. You see back in the Summer of last year I was working on my own rendering engine as a learning project. It was a few months after that I learnt of WebAssembly and that I could take my engine and render it directly in any compatible browser. One day I want to work in the video game industry so I thought that it might be a good showcase of my skills if I can demo directly in the browser. Through some inspiration I realized I could post along as I write the code in the form of live demoes. And this, although very simple, is the start of that. I also want to use this website as an opportunity to play around in the Rust programming language. I like the idea that a whole project need not be made in one language and that in fact Rust is a good language with it's useful FFI and interoperability. I would like to show that it is possible to link C++ and Rust together in a WebAssembly project. The code for this simple demo is below.</p> main.cpp<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n#include &lt;SDL.h&gt;\n#include &lt;GLES2/gl2.h&gt;\n\nint main()\n{\n    SDL_Window* window = nullptr;\n    window = SDL_CreateWindow(\"Hello World\",\n                              SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,\n                              SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,\n                              640,\n                              480,\n                              SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL);\n\n    if (window == nullptr)\n    {\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    SDL_GLContext glContext = SDL_GL_CreateContext(window);\n    glClearColor(1, 0, 0, 1);\n    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);\n\n    SDL_GL_DeleteContext(glContext);\n    SDL_DestroyWindow(window);\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Some immediate next steps are: ideally I'd want to figure out the appropriate width to render on different screen sizes and I must write a class to hold my shaders. A large part of the difficulty of this project is that WebAssembly currently has little support for DOM manipulation or querying. This makes it more difficult for me especially as javascript is not my forte but I am still excited to get to work on a polyglot programming project, something I have not done a lot in the past.</p>"},{"location":"2022/06/14/my-first-post-in-four-years/","title":"My First Post In Four Years","text":""},{"location":"2022/06/14/my-first-post-in-four-years/#departure-from-relic","title":"Departure from Relic","text":"<p>Working in the game industry was a lifelong dream of mine. Now that Age of Empires IV has been released I am now looking towards the future and figuring out what is next. Since my departure from Relic Entertainment I have been spending time working on some personal programming projects, this has involved learning various new technologies. This has included Unity, Unreal, Dear ImGui, various Boost libraries, and working at improving my C++ programming skills. One area I really want to explore for my career is Tools Development. I enjoyed the aspect of UI where I was interacting with and helping artists create their visions. As a tool's developer I see there being more room for getting into the headspace of an artist. I enjoy playing and learning different 3D tools so being able to create tools for them sounds exciting to me.</p>"},{"location":"2022/06/14/my-first-post-in-four-years/#life-blog","title":"Life + Blog","text":"<p>Also since my departure I have been getting back into healthy routines I had neglected.

In the past when I had started up blogging I always felt it had to be career related (I saw the art as part of my career motivation). Last year one of the most resonating quotes I heard was:</p> <p>How We Do Anything, Is How We Do Everything. </p> <p>I truly believe that if I focus on writing more it will improve my writing and comunication skills that will bleed over into all areas of my life.

It has many qualities which make it an ideal editor for notes or code for any developer, the greatest of which is that it's extensible, and the configuration will follow you for every future job you have. I started using it for a few reasons:</p> <ul> <li>I wanted a note/task manager which I could use at work and at home</li> <li>Solutions like Notion do not comply with some companies' data privacy regulations</li> </ul> <p>The more I learnt about it the more I realized it did all that and then some, and I keep on discovering new ways I can augment my Emacs experience.</p>"},{"location":"2022/06/14/my-first-post-in-four-years/#future-posting","title":"Future Posting","text":"<p>I want to post more and with that I need to focus on a different way of posting. I want to treat my blog like a digital garden. As Joel Hooks puts it:</p> <p>The phrase \"digital garden\" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the resulting \"showpiece\" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there.</p> <p>To me that means learning to take better notes on my various projects as I am working on them. While also making sure that I post as I go instead of holding onto something until it's done. I like to make sprints on projects but every so often switching to something different helps me move forward quicker. If I were to never post anything until finishing a project then I might never post anything. I think it's more important that I share unfinished ideas than hold onto them and never have them see the light of day. Want to clarify that my ideas aren't special and that by posting unfinished work I take the ego out of the equation.</p>"},{"location":"2022/06/14/my-first-post-in-four-years/#resources","title":"Resources","text":"<p>Joel Hooks - Digital Garden</p>"},{"location":"archive/2022/","title":"2022","text":""},{"location":"archive/2018/","title":"2018","text":""},{"location":"category/personal/","title":"personal","text":""},{"location":"category/programming/","title":"programming","text":""}]}

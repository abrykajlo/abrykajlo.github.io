It may not look like much but this litte red box is the start of a personal project which I hope will continue on for quite some time. It was in fact the reason why I built this website. You see back in the Summer of last year I was working on my own rendering engine as a learning project. It was a few months after that I learnt of WebAssembly and that I could take my engine and render it directly in any compatible browser. One day I want to work in the video game industry so I thought that it might be a good showcase of my skills if I can demo directly in the browser. Through some inspiration I realized I could post along as I write the code in the form of live demoes. And this, although very simple, is the start of that.

<div class="flex flex-col gap-y-4">
When I was in high school I had a dilemma. Do I pursue the visual arts and be a creative in
the game or VFX industry? Or do I double down on math and science to become a knowledge worker
in an engineering field? I chose the latter, so off I went to Queen's University in Kingston,
Ontario where I did 5 years of applied mathematics in mechanical engineering. Following that
up with a second degree in computer science I was ready to tackle the world.

Hi! I am Adam Brykajlo and for the last two years I have been working as a software developer
in Vancouver. And while I do love programming, I have a strong creative force in me that is
more and more manifesting it's urge to be visually creative. This website is a manifestation
of that need.

While the last few years have been spent honing my technical prowess my artistic ability has
stagnated. My interest in 3D modelling is still ever present so the next several months I want
to devote to learning 3D modelling and working on general artistic ability. Once I allow my
artistic ability to catch up I ultimately want to combine my artistic creativity with my
skills in mathematics, science and programming.
